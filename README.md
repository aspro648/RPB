What is it?

- Basically a 32U4 based Arduino with two card-edge slots instead of a shield layout.

Why?

- It started out as a 20-pin cable tester (Use Case 1), but morphed into a more generic prototyping system.

Features:

- USB programable Atmega 32U4.
- 20 i/o lines on card 1 position.
- Power, i2c, SPI on both card positions.
- Ability to check what card is plugged in each bay.
